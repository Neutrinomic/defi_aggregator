Adds a new query function with additional market data. A single call to the DeFi aggregator now also provides a 7-day chart (6-hour ticks) for all tokens against ICP, and ICP, BTC, ETH against USD. It provides the data enabling easy calculation of 24-hour and 7-day changes and allows for the creation of mini charts. This makes it simpler for wallets to access all the necessary data with one call and also without the need for complicated algorithms.
